We need more key pairs than ever so I released [a GitHub action](https://github.com/gitx-io/ssh-keygen-action) to run `ssh-keygen` command and create key pairs.

You can create key pairs in web page securely just by clicking.

## Quick start

1. [Use the template](https://github.com/gitx-io/ssh-keygen-template/generate) to create a repo, better as a private repo for secrity
2. Go to `Actions` top menu page, follow the steps as below:
![ssh keygen action steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/image-store/github/master/ssh-key-template.png)
3. After one minute or two, you'll see two files, `private_key.txt` and `public_key.txt`, are added/updated in repo's root direcotory when the action finished successfully
4. Open each file and click `Copy raw contents` button on the top right to copy the key

Done!
